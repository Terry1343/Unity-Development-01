# Unity-Development-01
This repository is logging my past programming I have done in Unity to learn game development in C#
It shows examples of prototypes that remain, unfortionatly a couple prototypes including a development ontop of one posted here have been lost.
Of the builds lost was the first project that I made to learn the basics of unity navigation and more basic programming
And I have also lost developments on the build called realm rush that makes it more visualy apealing and incorporates Breadth First Search pathfinding
