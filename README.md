# Unity-Development-01
This repository is logging my past programming I have done in Unity to learn game development in C#
It shows a timeline of me learning new skills
I will include several different builds of games with included descriptions of what they taught me to the best of my memory
I sadly don't have full memory of each new skill that these prototypes taught me as they're 10 months old, but having semi-anotated / described evidance of my work is better than nothing
